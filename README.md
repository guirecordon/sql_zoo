## Usage

This repository simply contains the answers to all of the exercise problems proposed on the SQL Zoo webpage. 

You'll find the page to the tutorial [here](https://sqlzoo.net/).


## Comments

This is not a comprehensive tutorial of SQL, but it does present some interesting challenges, especially around JOINs and self JOINs.

The one on self JOINs is the most challenging and I might wright an article about it in the near future. I'll update it here onced it is published.

## Acknowledgements

I've always had a lot of fun with SQL. This time around wasn't different, especially when working together with ezeilo-su and rodolforecordon, cracking our heads, trying to make sense of the London bus system tables!
